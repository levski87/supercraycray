Adds buttons in your toolbar to insert upto 7 types of ads on any side or inbetween your post content.



== Description ==



Insert ads in your post at the place of your choice in a single click. Adds buttons in your toolbar to place ads while writing your post. Now Inserting ads in your post is even simpler than underlining a word. All you need to do is put your Google Adsense code into the boxes provided and then click the corresponding button in tool bar to show the ads at place of your choice in post. Remember showing an ad at the right place in your post can result in much better revenue as compared to placing it randomly or some fixed place. You can also use ad-codes from other providers to show with adsense.





== Installation ==



The basic installation process is same as other plugins. Unpack and upload it to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. Go to Settings -> Insert. In Insert AdSense settings you will find seven text boxes where you can paste your adsense or other advertisement codes. Boxes six and seven are for adding ads on sides of your post while one to five add codes inbetween.

A link from your blog to www.yuyuh.com is highly appreciated. Please note that use of Ads Code 3 & 7 also adds a powered by link in the bottom. If you don't want to place this link in your site, use only other codes. Other codes will show only your ads and nothing else.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= How many google ads I can place =



You have the option to use seven types/formats of ads. However you should use a maximum of three adsense ads in one post as per google TOS. If you want to show more ads, use other advertiser codes i.e. adbright or bidvertiser codes as well in same post.



= Can I use other advertiser codes =



You can use any advertiser codes in the text boxes. Moreover you can also put any piece of text, personal ads, pictures link etc which you frequently use in your posts and place them in just a single click.



= How can I place infolinks code =



You can paste infolinks code as well in the boxes. However when you use the shortcode for infolinks code in posts it will not show anything there but will underline your adwords.



= Where are the ads shown in post/where should I use my ads =



Ads are shown at the place you chose to show them. To show the post at some specific place in your post, place the cursor there and click the relevent tool bar button for ad type/code you want to show. On clicking that button a short code will be added at the place of your cursor which will subsequently show ads on publishing.

Ads-code 6 and 7 also adds a table in your post so that you can write post content on right or left side of ads.

But try to add ads cleverly in your post. Adding an advertisement at right places can do miracles resulting in much more clicks.
